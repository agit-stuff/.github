**agit** captures the reasoning context (Why/How) alongside your code changes (What). It creates a "Neural Graph" parallel to Git's commit graph, giving you and your team a complete history of not just what changed, but *why* it changed and *how* the decision was made. Zero configuration with MCP auto-discovery and seamless integration with Cursor and Claude Code. Built on libgit2, works alongside your existing Git workflow so you don't have to change your workflow.
